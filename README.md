This Go program demonstrates the Lamport mutual exclusion algorithm, a distributed approach for achieving mutual exclusion in a system with multiple processes. The key components include:

LamportMutex: Maintains process-specific information such as timestamp, request status, and reply count.
Message: Represents communication between processes, including the sender, message type, and timestamp.
Global Variables: Arrays to manage mutexes, timestamps, queues, and communication channels.
The workflow involves processes deciding whether to request access to a critical section, managing incoming messages, and entering the critical section based on Lamport timestamps. Key functions handle message processing, queue management, and critical section access.
